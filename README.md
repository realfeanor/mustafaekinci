Hello everyone!

I am Mustafa Ekinci. I am a 28 years old man from Istanbul. I live with my parents and sister. I like writing code, playing video games, watching and playing soccer but most of the time i spend my time on my computer.

Also I graduated from Beykent University's Software Engineering department. I also studied English for one year there. I reached the upper intermediate level. I finished a course at an association called C & System Programmers Association. I learned C# language and object oriented programming there. I also got a certificate at the end of the course. I am developing applications using .net and sql query.

Currently i am working on a project called VideoGameStocks. I have finished some of it and i will upload it here. When i finish the project completely i will upload it again. I hope it's going to be good!
